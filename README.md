# :rocket: Useful Userscipts for HKU Students

A collection of userscripts that fix annoyances in websites commonly used by HKU students

## :bulb: Info

`HKUL Auth Autofill Fix.user.js`: Works around a Safari browser issue on the HKUL Login Page where login fields are misidentified as registration fields, disrupting the password autofill feature.

`Moodle Hide Courses.user.js`: Allows you to hide inactive courses from the homepage and sidebar.

`Moodle Stay as Current User.user.js`: Automatically clicks "Cancel" when Moodle displays the "you need to log out before logging in as a different user" prompt.

## :computer: How to Use

### Step 1: Install a Userscript Manager

Userscript managers come in the form of browser extensions.

I recommend the following open-source extensions:

| Browser | Extension Name | Installation Link |
| - | - | - |
| Safari | Userscripts | [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/userscripts/id1463298887) |
| Firefox | Violentmonkey | [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) |
| Google Chrome | Violentmonkey | [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) |
| Microsoft Edge | Violentmonkey | [Microsoft Edge Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao) |

Please make sure the extension is enabled before proceeding to the next step.
